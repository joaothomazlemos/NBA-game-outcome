# NBA-game-outcome

## Motivation

Hello! As I became a big fan of the NBA scene recently, and knowing that either I and my friends would be happy to know the results of a game previously,
I imediatelly started thinking of a NBA data science project.
Also, I thought that it would be nice to challenge myself into learning something new, and thats when webscraping came in to mind. It has the bonus of giving this project a 'start completely from zero aspect', which is great since the project would be more robust, thus, helping me in my journey to become a data scientist.




### THIS IS A WORK IN  PROGRESS

This work propose a model to predict NBA games outcomes in form of WIN or LOSS, starting since the webscraping step to get data,
until model deploy with predictions. Im planning to split each step into a separated folder.
