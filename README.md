# NBA-game-outcome

### Motivation

Hello! As I became a big fan of the NBA scene recently, and knowing that either I and my friends would be happy to know the results of a game previously,
I imediatelly started thinking of a NBA data science project.
Also, I thought that it would be nice to challenge myself into learning something new, and thats when webscraping came in to mind. It has the bonus of giving this project a 'start completely from zero aspect', which is great since the project would be more robust, thus, helping me in my journey to become a data scientist.

### Objective

This work propose a model to predict NBA games outcomes in form of WIN or LOSS, starting since the webscraping step to get data,
until model deploy with predictions. Below we can get some insight of what performance reference we should beat.

4 - Web Application development and deployment on cloud: (Coming soon)

### Results


With everything done, the predictions are coming from a refined Random Forest model, with accuracy up to 82%, and AUC as about 81% as seen in the graphic below.
