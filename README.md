# NBA-game-outcome

### Motivation

Hello! As I became a big fan of the NBA scene recently, and knowing that either I and my friends would be happy to know the results of a game previously,
I imediatelly started thinking of a NBA data science project.
Also, I thought that it would be nice to challenge myself into learning something new, and thats when webscraping came in to mind. It has the bonus of giving this project a 'start completely from zero aspect', which is great since the project would be more robust, thus, helping me in my journey to become a data scientist.

### Objective

This work propose a model to predict NBA games outcomes in form of WIN or LOSS, starting since the webscraping step to get data,
until model deploy with predictions.
