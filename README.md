# NBA-game-outcome

Project running on top of EC2 instance of AWS (free tier period), for public access. The data was fed automatically, on day-1, with the cron job running the web scraping script.

### Motivation

Hello! As I became a big fan of the NBA scene recently, and knowing that my friends and I would be happy to know the results of a game previously,
I immediately started thinking of an NBA data science project.
Also, I thought that it would be nice to challenge myself to learn something new, and that's when web scraping came to mind. It has the bonus of giving this project a 'start completely from zero aspect', which is excellent since the project would be more robust, thus, helping me in my journey to become a data scientist.

### Objective

This work proposes a model to predict NBA games outcomes in the form of WIN or LOSS, from the web scraping step to get data,
until the model deployment with predictions. Below we'll be able to give you some insight into what performance reference we should beat.

### Results


With everything done, the predictions are coming from a refined Random Forest model, with an accuracy of up to 82% and an AUC of about 81% as seen in the graphic below.
