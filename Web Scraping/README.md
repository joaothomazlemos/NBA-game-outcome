# NBA-game-outcome

## Motivation

Hello! As I became a big fan of the NBA scene recently, and knowing that either I and my friends would be happy to know the results of a game previously, I imediatelly started thinking of a NBA data science project.
Also, I thought that it would be nice to challenge myself into learning something new, and thats when webscraping came in to mind. It has the bonus of giving this project a 'start completely from zero aspect', which is great since the project would be more robust, thus, helping me in my journey to become a data scientist.

## Objective
The objective of this process is to store a dataframe where the columns would contain the basic and advanded stats for each team (last row of tables shown in images below), as well as the opponent stats that played against the former, located in the latter respectives boxscores. Additionaly, I added these columns for the best individual stats for each team as new columns, but this is entirely optional. So each row would display full stats of each team per game. Lastly but not less important, there are the column representing if that team won or not. Pheww, thats a lot of variables!











THIS IS A WORK IN  PROGRESS

This work propose a model to predict NBA games outcomes in form of WIN or LOSS
