# NBA games stats web scraping

## Objective
The objective of this process is to store a dataframe where the columns would contain the basic and advanded stats for each team (last row of tables shown in images below), as well as the opponent stats that played against the former, located in the latter respectives boxscores. Additionaly, I added these columns for the best individual stats for each team as new columns, but this is entirely optional. So each row would display full stats of each team per game. Lastly but not less important, there are the column representing if that team won or not. Pheww, thats a lot of variables!
